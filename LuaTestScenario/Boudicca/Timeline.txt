Turn 1 - late spring AD 60
-General Paulinus is near Anglesey with 14 G.M.V. - 10 cohorts
-2nd Augusta has 4 cohorts but stays behind in Anglesey

-Gloucester
--2,000 men of the 20th V.V. Evocati to call up near Gloucester

-The standard 20th V.V. has 2-3 cohorts near the Silures of South Wales who are unsubdued - they should stay behind to fight these because if they don't, then the whole western flank can collapse

--6 cohorts of 2nd Augusta (including the 1st) are at Exeter - they may or may not arrive

-Quintus Petillius Cerialis is in Longthorpe with 9th Hispana
--days before, relief force arrived and veterans had left England for land grants on the Rhine
--Most of Legion is to the north - won't be in this scenario
--Cerialis has 4 cohorts of inexperienced new legionarries and not the 1st legion
--He has some cavalrymen - 1 unit
