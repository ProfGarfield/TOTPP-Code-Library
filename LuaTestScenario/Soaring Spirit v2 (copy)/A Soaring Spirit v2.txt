^
After the Dark Age that extinguished the light of the Bronze Age
Mycenean Kingdoms, the Hellenes (as the Ancient Greeks called 
themselves) began to recover in around 750 B.C. Colonists from
the major City-States travelled throughout the Mediterranean and 
founded new cities.

THE NATIONS:
_________________________________________
%
THE ATHENIANS
%
The city of Athens during classical antiquity was a notable polis 
(city-state) of Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the 
Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. 
Athenian democracy was established in 510 BC under Cleisthenes 
following the tyranny of Hippias. This system remained remarkably 
stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 
170 years, until Alexander the Great conquered Athens in 338 BC. 
The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, 
known as the Age of Pericles.
%
In the classical period, Athens was a center for the arts, learning 
and philosophy, home of Plato's Akademia and Aristotle's Lyceum, 
Athens was also the birthplace of Socrates, Pericles, Sophocles, 
and its many other prominent philosophers, writers and politicians 
of the ancient world. It is widely referred to as the cradle of 
Western Civilization, and the birthplace of democracy, largely due 
to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 
5th and 4th centuries BC on the rest of the then known European 
continent.

THE SPARTANS
%
Sparta was a city-state in ancient Greece, situated on the River 
Eurotas in the southern part of the Peloponnese. From c. 650 BC it 
rose to become the dominant military power in the region and as such 
was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces 
during the Greco-Persian Wars.[2] Helots were the majority inhabitants 
of Sparta (over 80% of the population according to Herodotus). 
They were ritually humiliated and during the Crypteia they could be 
legally killed by Spartan citizens.[4][5][6] Between 431 and 404 BC 
Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War. 
By 362 BC Sparta's role as the dominant military power in Greece was 
over. Sparta continues to fascinate Western culture; an admiration of 
Sparta is called laconophilia.

THE CORINTHIANS
%
In classical times, Corinth rivaled Athens and Thebes in wealth, 
based on the Isthmian traffic and trade. Until the mid-6th century 
Corinth was a major exporter of black-figure pottery to cities around 
the Greek world. Athenian potters later came to dominate the market. 
Corinth's great temple on its ancient acropolis was dedicated to the 
goddess Aphrodite. According to most sources, there were more than 
one thousand temple prostitutes employed at the Temple of Aphrodite. 
Corinth was also the host of the Isthmian Games.
%
The city had two main ports, one in the Corinthian Gulf and one in the 
Saronic Gulf, serving the trade routes of the western and eastern 
Mediterranean, respectively. In the Corinthian Gulf lay Lechaion, which 
connected the city to its western colonies and Magna Graecia, while in 
the Saronic Gulf the port of Kenchreai served the ships coming from 
Athens, Ionia, Cyprus and the rest of the Levant. Both ports had docks 
for the large war fleet of the city-state.

THE IONIANS
%
The Ionians were one of the three populations into which the ancient 
Greeks considered the population of Hellenes to have been divided.

"Ionian" with reference to populations had two senses in Classical 
Greece. In a narrow sense they were linked by their use of the Ionic 
dialect spoken in settlements that were located principally on some of 
the Islands between Greece and Anatolia, but who resided on the coast 
of Anatolia as well, giving rise to the eponymously named region of 
Ionia there. All the Greeks understood that the population of Ionia 
were descendants of migrants from the Peloponnesus and had ceded their 
native land to the Dorians. After a residence in Athens they and some 
Athenians emigrated to Anatolia and the islands. In a broader sense 
Ionian meant all the speakers of Ionian, Attic (the language spoken 
at Athens) and any other dialects of the group called East Greek today.
% 
The location of ancient Ionia on the coast of modern-day Turkey. 
The other two language/cultural groups of the classical period were 
the Dorians and the Aeolians. All three groups were known collectively 
as Hellenes. The Ionians were located around the shores of the Aegean 
Sea and in most of the Aegean islands. The Aeolians resided in Boeotia, 
Lesbos with a few other islands and the coast of Anatolia. Dorians were 
to be found in Macedon, Peloponnesus, Crete, Rhodes and the islands of 
the Dorian Hexapolis, as well as on the coast of Anatolia. Thrace was 
home to Greek colonists of Ionian descent and the French city of 
Marseille was founded by Ionians from Phocaea in Ionia.
%
According to semi-historical Greek legend, Ionia was colonised by 
refugees from mainland Greece expelled by the invading Dorians in the 
Heroic Age. According to myth, the Ionians were descended from the 
hero Ion, son of Xuthus, son of Hellen (the mythical progenitor of 
all the Hellenes, whose other two sons were Aeolus and Dorus).

THE PHOENICIANS
%
The Phoenicians were amongst the greatest traders of their time and owed 
a great deal of their prosperity to trade. The Phoenicians' initial 
trading partners were the Greeks, with whom they used to trade wood, 
slaves, glass and a Tyrian Purple powder. This powder was used by the 
Greek elite to color clothes and other garments and was not available 
anywhere else. Without trade with the Greeks they would not be known as 
Phoenicians, as the word for Phoenician is derived from the Ancient 
Greek word phoinikèia meaning "purple".
%
In the centuries following 1200 BC, the Phoenicians formed the major 
naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on 
Tyrian Purple, a violet-purple dye derived from the Murex sea-snail's 
shell, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern 
Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. Brilliant 
textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician glass was 
another export ware. 
%
The Phoenicians established commercial outposts throughout the 
Mediterranean, the most strategically important being Carthage in North 
Africa, directly across the narrow straits. However, ancient Gaelic 
mythologies of origin attribute a Phoenician/Scythian influx to Ireland 
by a leader called Fenius Farsa. Others also sailed south along the coast 
of Africa. A Carthaginian expedition led by Hanno the Navigator explored 
and colonized the Atlantic coast of Africa as far as the Gulf of Guinea; 
and according to Herodotus, a Phoenician expedition sent down the Red 
Sea by pharaoh Necho II of Egypt (c. 600 BC) even circumnavigated Africa 
and returned through the Pillars of Hercules in three years.

THE ETRUSCANS
%
Etruscan civilization is the modern English name given to the culture 
and way of life of a people of ancient Italy and Corsica whom the ancient 
Romans called Etrusci or Tusci. The Attic Greek word for them was 
Tyrrhenioi from which Latin also drew the names Tyrrheni (Etruscans), 
Tyrrhenia (Etruria) and Mare Tyrrhenum (Tyrrhenian Sea). The Etruscans 
themselves used the term Rasenna, which was syncopated to Rasna or Rasna.
%
As distinguished by its own language, the civilization endured from an 
unknown prehistoric time prior to the founding of Rome until its complete 
assimilation to Italic Rome in the Roman Republic. At its maximum extent 
during the foundation period of Rome and the Roman kingdom, it flourished 
in three confederacies of cities: of Etruria, of the Po valley with the 
eastern Alps, and of Latium and Campania. Rome was sited in Etruscan 
territory. There is considerable evidence that early Rome was dominated 
by Etruscans until the Romans sacked Veii in 396 BC.
%
Culture that is identifiably and certainly Etruscan developed in Italy 
after about 800 BC approximately over the range of the preceding Iron Age 
Villanovan culture. The latter gave way in the seventh century to a 
culture that was influenced by Greek traders and Greek neighbours in 
Magna Graecia, the Hellenic civilization of southern Italy. After 500 BC 
the political destiny of Italy passed out of Etruscan hands.

THE LYDIANS / PERSIANS (AI ONLY)
%
Lydia was an Iron Age kingdom of western Asia Minor located generally 
east of ancient Ionia in the modern Turkish provinces of Manisa and 
inland Izmir. Its population spoke an Anatolian language known as Lydian.
%
At its greatest extent, the Kingdom of Lydia covered all of western 
Anatolia. Lydia was later the name for a Roman province. Coins were 
invented in Lydia around 610 BC.
%
In 546 BC, the Achaemenid king Cyrus II the Great captured Sardis and 
Lydia became his satrapy.
%
For the first part of this scenario this nation represents the wealthy 
Lydian Kingdom. As the game goes on the Lydian Kingdom is incorporated
into the Persian Empire which will launch the invasions of Cyrus and 
Xerxes
