-- Cities
-- recommended key prefix 'c'
-- It is not recommended to put cities into this list if the city
-- can be destroyed. This list returns an error if 'nil' is the value
-- associated with the key (see bottom of file), so that could cause
-- a problem if a city in this list is destroyed.  Also, if another
-- city is founded, the ID number of the city might get reused, causing
-- more confusion.  An alternate way to reference a city is by using
