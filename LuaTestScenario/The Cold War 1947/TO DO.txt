NECESSARY STEPS TO COMPLETE THE SCENARIO


EVENTS:
-Purchase Unit Event (need seller to set conditions and buyer to purchase.  Should default to middle ground to accomodate SP game, and randomly change in SP only).

-Sub Slips By Event (key press brings up button that asks if sub should teleport 3 spaces E, W, N, S to prevent players from blocking straits).
-SALT treaty (should limit # of nuclear weapons tribes can possess with penalty for possessing more if signatory, and benefit to possessing same or less if signatory).


-Rebel Spawn Event (Perhaps based on regions or perhaps just a table.  Can purchase units on tiles of choice).

-Pressing button brings up dialogue box for Tier #1
Tier I - REGION (Asia [option1], Latin America [option2], Africa [option3]) - selecting option brings you to tier II
Tier II - Area (ex. Vietnam, Indonesia, Phillipeans) - slection option brings you to tier III
Tier III - Effort Level (ex. high, medium, low)

high has higher cost but gives most units/better units
medium has mid cost and gives average units
low has low cost and gives weak units and less of them

probably in SP, want to have this also spawn opposing forces.  

low will spawn comparable # of opposition
mid will spawn slightly less opposition
high will spawn very much less opposition
