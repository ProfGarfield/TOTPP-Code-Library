Changes from A Soaring Spirit 1.3

Fortresses were removed from all squares, and TOTPP was used to make terrain stackable.  Unit defense stats have been doubled.

Using TOTPP, cities will not lose population when attacked, and will only lose population when captured as long as the city will not be destroyed.

Cities of Black Sea Ports, Egyptian Ports, and Western Ports added.  These have a Palaces and Walls.

Turns now represent 5 years.  By pressing 'k' when adjacent to land, a sea unit can restore its movement to full (except for a fractional movement point, which keeps track of the remaining 'charges' available).


If the player attempts to build a city with a unit other than a colonist, the player will be warned, and the city will disappear if they actually build it.  Similarly, a city not built on a colony site will disappear.  The 'fertility' value has been changed for each tile, so villages should not produce cities.  However, if they do, they will also disappear.

Stonecutting advance is now Tactics instead of Construction, so no fortresses can be built.

Have made many units immune to bribery.  Have changed the bribery message forbidding the bribery of player and Persian units.  Now, if a unit can be bribed to join a player, it can be bribed away also.
@DESERT
Remember, only Barbarians and Lydian Barbarians can be bribed,
no player units or Persians!

;Remember, only Barbarians and Lydians can be bribed.

Colonists, Engineers, Citizens, and Helots are 'enslaved' (i.e. a slave unit is generated for the winner) when they are defeated.  Slaves are also captured.  A suitable message is generated.

Added code so that only citizens and colonists can join cities.

Every player turn, each colonySite has a 1/90 chance to "upgrade"
If no richVillage on the tile, add a rich village,
If 1 or 2 rich villages, add 2 more rich villages
If 3 or more rich villages, add a fortress
If a fortress, turn into a minor city.

If an attacking unit has a strategos in the same square, it does 20% of the defender's HP in damage before the attack begins.  If the defending unit has a strategos in the square, and the unit can be killed in the next round of combat, do 2x that unit's firepower in damage to the attacker.  (This applies in every round of combat where the defender risks being killed.)

Currency and Papyrus have been swapped in the tech tree, so currency is now Trade, and allows clicking on foreign cities to discover supply and demand, and allows the supply and demand window to be opened in the regular game.  Unfortunately, when building a caravan, the supply and demand window was opened, allowing easy circumvention of the mechanic.
