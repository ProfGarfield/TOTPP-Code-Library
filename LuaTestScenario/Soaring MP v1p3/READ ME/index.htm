<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
After the Dark Age that extinguished the light of the Bronze Age
Mycenean Kingdoms, the Hellenes (as the Ancient Greeks called 
themselves) began to recover in around 750 B.C. Colonists from
the major City-States travelled throughout the Mediterranean and 
founded new cities.</P>
Colonization was the solution which the Greeks hit upon to remedy 
the evils of oligarchical domination. Most of the emigrants who from 
the beginning of the eighth century left their native soil were country 
people in search of land to cultivate. It is importante, however, to 
notice that not every emigrating Greek became a colonist. Many of the more 
adventurous hired themselves to eastern sovereigns as mercenary soldiers. 
Nevertheless Greek colonisation was of the greatest historical significance 
since it resulted in the formation of a 'New World' which was Hellenic. 
At first a hunger for land was the prime motive which sent the Greek 
countryman across the seas. But as commerce began to assume a place of 
greater importance in the life of Greece, other preoccupations arose: 
a search for new export markets, the seizure of strategic positions in 
order to protect trade from competitors. But it was not until the seventh 
century that these things became matters of deliberate policy.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The colonial movement was at first haphazard and unplanned: the colonists 
formed groups at will and settled wherever they found a suitable place. 
But unoccupied land was rare and the natives often unfriendly. To instal        
themselves in such places required force, and warlike preperations had to 
be made in advance. Not all Greek cities were populous, and it was sometimes 
difficult to find a sufficient number of emigrants to form a colony. The        
venture had then to be made in conjunction with neighbouring cities. In the 
end colonisation became so important for economic and imperialist reasons 
that the state took over its direction. The city government would appoint a        
leader. In charge of the group of intending colonists, he was the oikistes, 
or founder. He was given his destination and provided with a staff of 
soothsayers and surveyors. When the colony was established it adopted the        
religion and the laws of the city which founded it. The obligations of the 
colony to the metropolis were limited and even as far as domestic agrarian 
expansion was concerned; but when any colony showed signs of political and        
economic independence the metropolis wass less tolerant. Corinth was 
particularly determined to maintain a strict control over her colonies, 
and this policy resulted in violent conflicts with the more powerful of them 
(notably Corcyra) when they claimed the right to determine their own fate.</P>

During the course of this scenario you will recreate the exploration and 
colonization of the Mediterranean by the Hellenes, Etruscans and Phoenicians. 
You will also engage in trade and scientific research and no doubt a little 
bit of combat, especially once te Persians arrive from the east.<br>
 I hope you enjoy it!</P>
