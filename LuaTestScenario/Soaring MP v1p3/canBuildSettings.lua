--      .overrideDefaultBuildFunction = boolean or nil
--          if true, the in game function for determining if the item can be built is ignored
--          for improvements and wonders, a check will be made if the item has already been built
--          false, nil, absent means the game's regular conditions must also be met
--      .forbiddenAlternateProduction = unitTypeObject or imprvementObject or wonderObject or table of these objects
--          the city can only build the item if city:canBuild(item) returns false for all items in the list
--          Be careful that the 'can build chain' does not form a loop
--          A single entry not in a table will be 'wrapped' with a table in post processing
--      .requireSomeAsAlternateProduction = unitTypeObject or improvementObject or wonderObject or table of these objects
--          the city can only build the item if city:canBuild(item) is true for at least one item in the list
--          Be careful that the 'can build chain' does not form a loop
--          A single entry not in a table will be 'wrapped' with a table in post processing

--          (happens before overrideFunction and alternateParameters)
--      .overrideFunction = function(defaultBuildFunction,city,item) --> boolean
--          if function returns true, the city is automatically allowed to build the item, regardless of any
--          conditions that isn't met
--          if function returns false, the other conditions are checked
--      .alternateParameters = table of itemParameters
--          itemParameters is this table of restrictions on whether a given item can be produced
--          if the item in question satisfies any of the itemParameters in the table, it can be produced,
--          regardless of whether the 'top' itemParameters are satisfied
--          use this (or overrideFunction) if you want to have more than one valid way to produce the item
--          the 'table' format is important.  Unlike other parameters, you must enclose the value of 
--          alternateParameters in a table, even if there is only one itemParameters as the value
