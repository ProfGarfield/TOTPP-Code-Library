PREFACE TO THE TEST OF TIME CONVERSION PROJECT EDITION V.ToT1.1a

This is the third in the series from the Test of Time Conversion Poject. 
The objective of the project is to convert classic Civ2 scenarios to the 
more powerful Test of Time version, and to update the graphics, using the 
wealth of outstanding artwork produced since these scenarios were first made. 

With the outstanding unit and city artwork work of Sarrstock, as well as terrain 
by Favoured Flight and Catfish, the ToT version is a visual delight. Their art, 
and the wonderfully crafted scenario of Carl Fritz (Gothmog) emerse the player deep 
into the geography and history of the "Scramble for Africa".

Except for new graphics, the scenario is virtually unchanged. Test of Time has allowed 
the sounds to be simplified, and a few have been changed. New leader sounds are from 
other games, ie. Medieval Total War and Waterloo. The original graphics interface has 
been retained as much as possible, with some modification due to the different screens 
of ToT. 

"Brown Man's Burden II (ToT) is a classic reborn. Enjoy!

Brown Man's Burden II: the Scramble for Africa (Ver. 1.1),
A Civ2 Scenario by Carl Fritz
EMAIL: cfritz@stargate.net

Version 1.1 Change summary
~ Some minor tweaks to the rules and events.
~ Major terrain graphics changes

SUMMARY
The Berlin Conference of 1884 set off a race among European powers to claim
as much land as possible in Africa. This scenario recreates the Scrambe for
Africa. It begins in 1889 when Italy has set up new colonies in Somalia and
looks to take over Abyssinia. Menelik II, the new Emperor of Abyssinia is
having none of that and looks to expand his empire. Britain, France, Germany,
Portugal, and the Ottoman Empire have their own agendas: Britain would like
to regain Sudan from the Mahdists and expand in South Africa, France would like
to extend its empire in West Africa, Germany and Portugal try to expand their
claims in East Africa, and the Ottomans would like to restore their empire to 
its former glory.

Time Frame: 1889 thru 1914 using 6 turns per year
Geography: Africa and Saudi Arabian Penninsula
Tribes: Italy, Germany, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Ottoman Empire, Abyssinia.
        all playable
Scoring: Objective Scoring

INSTALLATION:
This scenario requires the Fantastic Worlds (FW) add-on for Civilization II.
Installation is easiest if you use WinZip to extract these files.
1. When you extract point to the SCENARIO folder of your CIV II root
directory and check the "use folder names" option. This will create a folder named
BROWNMAN. All files will go into this folder.

If you do not use WinZip or don't want to use the "user folder names" option,
do this.
1. Create a new folder in the SCENARIO folder of your CIV II root directory.
Extract the files to the new folder. 

DISCLAIMER:
Sticklers for complete historical accuracy should make their own scenarios. My main
objective is to make a playable scenario, not to make an historical simulation.
The starting positions are historical, but the end result will not be.

NOTES:
This scenario is the child of the original Brown Man's Burden that was entered in
the Scenario League Contest at Apolyton. Because that was done in a short period of
time, I was never really satisfied with that effort. 
1. The base map had a lot of problems, especially rivers and mountain ranges.
2. I should have included the Ottomans instead of the Mahdists.
3. The unit selection was kind of cheesy (Zeppelins and what not!)

BMB II has been created to fix these problems. It has resulted in a major overhaul.
1. Many map problems have been corrected. No doubt many problems remain, Africa is 
a big place after all. A lot of new cities have been added.
2. The Mahdists have been turned into barbarians and replaced with Ottomans. This puts
the Near East into play.
3. All flying units are gone. Unit stats have been reworked. Diplomat types only appear
as the result of special events.
4. The scenario has had a graphic facelift as well. New units, new terrain, new icons.
5. The time scale is now: 1 turn = 2 months.

In short it's a whole new scenario.

GAMEPLAY:
~ Ottoman Empire and Abyssinians are the only tribes that generate partisans.
~ Each tribe gets an envoy or spy when discovering foreign policy or espionage.
~ Otherwise, envoys and spies are not a buildable unit.
~ Many cities have the function of building ships, ports, and coastal forts disabled.
~ Terrain does not always function the way it does in a standard game.
~ The Boer War is triggered by the German discovery of High Explosives so it does not
occur according to the historical time line.
~ Events are used mostly to generate barbarians.

SOUND
~ Rifle fire and Zulu sounds from the Movie ZULU
~ Cavalry sounds borrowed from 1884 Scenario by Matthias Pitz and mixed with
  the rifle fire sound above by the author.
~ Some event samples are from Microsoft Encarta.
