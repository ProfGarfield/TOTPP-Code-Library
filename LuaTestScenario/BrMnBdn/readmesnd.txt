SOUND FILE INSTALLATION:
This scenario requires the Fantastic Worlds (FW) add-on for Civilization II.
Installation is easiest if you use WinZip to extract these files.
1. When you extract point to the SCENARIO folder of your CIV II root
directory and check the "use folder names" option. This will create a
folder named and BROWNMAN/SOUND. All files will go into this folder.
2. After finishing with WinZip, go to the newly created BROWNMAN/SOUND folder
and run Sound.bat. This will create all of the wav files needed.

If you don't have winzip or don't want to use the "user folder names" option,
do this.
1. If you don't use the "use folder names option", create a folder named
SOUND with in the Brown Man's Burden II scenario folder and unzip the files
there. 
2. Open the SOUND folder and run Sound.bat. This will create all of the wav files needed.
