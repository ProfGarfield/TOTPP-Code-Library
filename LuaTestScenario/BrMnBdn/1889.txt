^"Pile on the brown man's burden and, if ye rouse his hate, 
^ Meet his old-fashioned reasons with Maxims up to date." 
^^Henry Labouchère, 1899 (parody of White Man's Burden by Kipling)
^
^The Berlin Conference of 1884 set off a race among European powers to claim as much 
land as possible in Africa. This scenario recreates the Scrambe for Africa. It begins 
in 1889 when Italy has set up new colonies in Somalia and looks to take over Abyssinia. 
Menelik II, the new Emperor of Abyssinia is having none of that and looks to 
expand his empire. Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, and the Ottoman Empire have their 
own agendas: Britain would like to regain Sudan from the Mahdists and expand in South 
Africa, France would like to extend its empire in West Africa, Germany and Portugal try to  
expand their claims in East Africa, and the Ottomans would like to restore their empire to 
its former glory.
All civilizations are playable, but some are easier than others.
^  ~ Hardest:  Abyssinians, Ottomans, Italians
^  ~ Middling: Germans, Portuguese
^  ~ Easiest:  Englishmen, Frenchmen
^The Game ends with the outbreak of World War I.
^SPECIAL RULES: No Government changes, No Space Race (of course!),
^  6 turns per year. Slow Population Growth.
